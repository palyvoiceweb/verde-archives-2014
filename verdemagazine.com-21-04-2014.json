The tradition of flying has been passed down bloodlines.\r\n<div><\/div>\r\nPalo Alto students Paige Hansen, Cormac Siegfried and Th\u00e9o Zaharias bring popular childhood dream of flying to life. United States law does not require children to be a particular age to begin flight training, but aspiring pilots must be 16 years old to solo and 17 to obtain a pilots license.\r\n\r\nWhen a person soloes, their instructor oberves them from the ground and keeps a radio handy in order to give mid-flight instructions.\r\n\r\nThis October will mark Hansen\u2019s two-year anniversary of flying. She began as a sophomore when her father, who had been flying for nine years, encouraged her to learn.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dad wanted me to take lessons because he needed a co-pilot,\u201d Hansen says.\r\n\r\nShe soloed for the first time in September of 2013.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 the biggest milestone because it shows you can handle the airplane on your own,\u201d Hansen says.\r\n\r\nFlight is a family affair for Siegfried,\u00a0 a senior and former Palo Alto High School student and current Lydian Academy and Foothill College student.\r\n\r\n\u201cI pretty much grew up in this plane,\u201d Siegfried says, gesturing to his family\u2019s BE-18S.\r\n\r\nThe expectation has always been that he would learn to fly. Siegfried learned from his father, who learned from his father in turn.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe set expectations\u2026that you do well in school, that your honest, that your good citizens, all of those things,\u201d Siegfried\u2019s father, Rand Siegfried, says. \u201cAnother expectation is that you\u2019re going to learn how to fly.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe learned to fly alongside his sister, former Palo Alto High School student McKinely Siegfried.\r\n\r\nSiegfried\u2019s gandfather had always yearned to fly and obtained his license at age 17. Siegfried began flying as soon as his feet could reach the pedal and earned his license at the same age.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t ever an option but to learn to fly, but I also never even considered not learning,\u201d Siegfried says.<a href=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/Lesson.tif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3761\" src=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/Lesson.tif\" alt=\"Lesson\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/Palyyyy.jpg\" alt=\"Palyyyy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/>\r\n\r\n<b>AERIAL VIEW\u00a0\u00a0<\/b>Paige Hansen flies over Palo Alto High School, top left. 1500 ft is the lowest a plane can fly over a city.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPaly junior Zaharias began flying last year, when his father decided to learn.

He is about halfway through the process of getting his pilot\u2019s license.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust being able to go up there and see things from a new perspective\u2026 it\u2019s just kind of liberating,\u201d Zaharias says.\r\n\r\nFor Zaharias, flying provides a broader lens through which to view the world.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy favorite flying is over the remote valleys and rural areas because there\u2019s so many things to see that people in Palo Alto would never get to see otherwise,\u201d Zaharias says. \u201cIt\u2019s eye opening.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn his many years of flying, Siegfried has flown over 200 hours, including a nine hour trip with a single pit stop.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy favorite type [of airport] has no tower; [it\u2019s] a sort of grass airport,\u201d Seigfried says.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have nowhere to go,\u201d Siegfried says.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re just flying cause you\u2019re having so much fun.\u201d\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3713\" style=\"cursor: default; border: 0px initial initial;\" src=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/PushingTheplane.jpg\" alt=\"PushingTheplane\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/>\r\n\r\n<b>PUSH\u00a0 <\/b>Paige Hansen and her instructor, Will McAdams, previous page, push the plane in preparation for her flying lesson.

According to Smith, who still coordinates the event, the original plan was to do a marathon, but the idea came up to run a flea market during the race. At first an afterthought, the market proved to be a quick success.\r\n\u201cPeople are always looking for a bargain, that\u2019s a fact of life,\u201d Smith says. \u201cPeople came when they heard that there was going to be a flea market here.\u201d\r\nTo gather funds, the band sells spots to vendors ahead of time and runs a barbecue the day of the market. According to current band director Jeff Willner, the barbecue is an efficient way to help the vendors as well as the school. Besides bringing in money, it assures that the vendors do not have to leave their stalls to get food, and thus miss potential customers.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3839\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"200\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/jewelry.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3839 \" src=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/jewelry.jpg\" alt=\"jewelry\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> Handmade jewelry hangs on a stand at a stall in the middle aisle of the market.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3845\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo7.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-3845\" src=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/photo7.jpg\" alt=\"photo7\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a> Trinkets rest in a glass case, awaiting inspection from potential customers.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the vital funds that the event is able to provide for the band, Willner attests to the unique experience that the market provides.\r\n\u201cA lot of the flea markets you go to now, it\u2019s a lot of people selling new garbage,\u201d Willner says. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a real live flea market, It\u2019s people selling stuff from out of their garage... So it\u2019s a little more diverse and eclectic than a lot of them that you go to now.\u201d\r\nThe flea market\u2019s uncommon environment, as well as being a product of the wide variety of merchandise available, results from its small and manageable size.\r\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t outgrown our capability of being able to control it,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple of incidences in the past where we have not invited people back, but because we\u2019re small, we\u2019ve really been able to keep a handle on that type of thing.\u201d\r\nAs the years have gone by, the band has become increasingly adept at running the event.

Students are then graded on these components, rather than the final innovation.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe students are allowed to fail, but they have to learn something from their failure and present that to the class,\u201d Hinton says. \u201cNot failing just means that they\u2019re not trying hard enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nHowever, most students haven\u2019t had to face this anguish.

Gaps in the trees reveal miles of greenery intermingled with houses set against a backdrop of bright blue sky. The forest eventually opens at the intersection of Skyline and 84 to reveal a wood cabin, guarded by an iron owl and an American flag. A welcoming front porch beckons behind an asphalt parking lot overflowing with motorcycles and teeming with life. Picnic tables line the porch, crammed with the patrons of Alice\u2019s Restaurant. On the far side of the porch, through a set of doors, lies the main inside area of Alice\u2019s, and a building in the back houses an additional bar.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The restaurant, renowned for its unique location and ambience, serves classic American comfort food. Alice Taylor opened the restaurant in the 1960s, naming it after herself and after an Arlo Guthrie anti-war song of the same name, but the restaurant has since changed hands and is now owned by a different family. According to their website, the building was a general store catering to local loggers in the early 1900s before being converted into a restaurant in the 1950s.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3786\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"360\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/alicecar.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-3786  \" alt=\"alicecar\" src=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/alicecar.jpg\" width=\"360\" height=\"240\" \/><\/a> An old Volkswagen bug sits in front of Alice's.

Alice\u2019s is a notorious biker hangout, and conversation is often punctuated by the revving of motorcycle engines. The patrons at Alice\u2019s are friendly, smiling and making conversation with a genial American hospitality. Alice\u2019s is the type of place where waitresses call customers \u201choney\u201d and smile as they take orders.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the more subtle pleasures of the restaurant is the drive there. The roads wind up through the Santa Cruz mountains, and you can choose between the peaceful redwood forests of Kings Mountain or Old La Honda roads, the spectacular views of Page Mill Rd., or the more direct yet slightly less scenic route 84. It takes approximately half an hour to get from downtown Palo Alto to the restaurant, so Alice\u2019s is definitely a place that should be reserved for leisurely weekends.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3781\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"240\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/aliceinside2.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-3781 \" alt=\"aliceinside\" src=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/aliceinside2.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"360\" \/><\/a> The inside seating area of the restaurant.

Customers seat themselves at one of the picnic tables on the restaurant\u2019s deck, often sharing a table with at least one other party. The tables are set up in a communal, open-seating arrangement. The porch, warmed by numerous heat lamps during cold weather, feels cozy despite its open-air format. The restaurant\u2019s indoor seating area is similar to the outside, though it has upholstered booths and single-party tables. In the back is a bar with a smaller porch, which looks out on a backyard lawn, where children often play while they wait for their families to finish eating. The location in the redwoods makes for a refreshing, natural atmosphere impossible in an urban setting.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Alice\u2019s is an excellent place to escape to with friends after a long, hard week. It is a refuge: a cabin among the trees where one can seek a good meal and get away from the mind-numbing grind of day-to-day life, if just for a little while.<\/p>","excerpt":"Late afternoon sunlight filters through towering redwood trees, creating dappled shadows on the asphalt of the snaking highway CA 84 as it ascends the Woodside mountains.

The strings spin velvet melodies and the occasional burst of laughter rolls out onto the sidewalk. Palo Alto High School seniors Tessera Chin and Megan Rohrer, are practicing their instruments together.\r\n\r\nIn the music room of Chin\u2019s house, the girls furrow their brows a little as they focus on Handel\u2019s \u201cPassacaglia.\u201d Sweet, complicated music flows from their bows and through the room, bouncing off the walls. Their thin fingers dance on the violin and viola, their other arm directing wooden bows swiftly across the strings. Occasionally, they peer at each other and giggle. But they never stop playing.\r\n\r\nRehearsals like this are common, because both Chin and Rohrer are diligent musicians and practice often. They are both in the Palo Alto Chamber Orchestra, or PACO, a prestigious musical community of the Bay Area\u2019s most talented musicians. Rohrer is an advanced violinist and Chin plays both the violin and the viola.\r\n\r\nPACO holds four concerts every season and three to four hours of rehearsal weekly, but Chin and Rohrer still make time for quartet performances at such venues as the Stanford Shopping Center, Neiman Marcus and the American Heart Association. The events they play at include weddings, funerals, open houses and fundraisers. Chin and Rohrer say that they\u2019ve done more than 50 gigs thus far and, because they are good friends, they do most of their gigs together.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/weird.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3817\" alt=\"weird\" src=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/weird.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nChin\u2019s love of music is steeped in tradition. Her grandmother taught her to sing Chinese operas; her father started her on violin when she was in first grade; her older brother majored in music at the University of Southern California and her sister plays the cello; and both siblings are pianists. Music is in Chin\u2019s blood.\r\n\r\n\u201cI honestly can\u2019t remember a time when music wasn\u2019t part of my life,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nChin joined the Palo Alto Chamber Orchestra in 4th grade. Starting from Superstrings, the most juvenile among the five orchestras in the organization, she worked her way up to higher level orchestras. Orchestra has remained her major extra-curricular activity throughout the years, and she says that she spends about 10 hours total practicing each week.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy family is pretty dedicated to music,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nChin\u2019s house has become a center for rehearsals, as her father teaches group music classes. When her parents remodeled the house in 2001, they designed the music room just for the kids to practice in, Chin says.\r\n\r\nRohrer\u2019s earliest forays into music were very different. She grew up in New Mexico, where she was in the Albuquerque Youth Symphony, moving to California just before her freshman year.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was scared to leave because I had an orchestra that I really liked there,\u201d Rohrer says. \u201cIt was pretty much the only one in New Mexico...I was one of the best violinists my age. I was in a quartet, but it wasn\u2019t very serious. The music community was just so much smaller.\u201d\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/cool.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3834\" alt=\"cool\" src=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/cool.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nThe two joined in 2011 when Rohrer had just moved from New Mexico. In the Santa Cruz mountains, Rohrer met Chin at the Summer Chamber Orchestra Workshop, or PACO camp. Together, they faced one week of intense rehearsals.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was really intimidated because the music world was so much bigger, and it seemed like everyone played at a higher level and there were so many people who were so much better than me,\u201d Rohrer says.\r\n\r\nBen Simon, the director of PACO, says that Rohrer seemed \u201cextremely nervous when she first started,\u201d but that it was clear that PACO was the perfect fit for her. She was quick to befriend bright, talented girls like Chin and her sister, Delenn Chin.\r\n\r\nRohrer says that playing with many talented musicians pushed her to try harder and improve.\r\n\r\nEven though there are many talented and dedicated students at PACO, the environment is by all accounts competitivity free.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a community to belong,\u201d Chin says. \u201cMost of my friends are from PACO\u2026 We\u2019re all comfortable around each other and confident in the music that we\u2019re able to produce together.\u201d\r\n\r\nOther than focusing on improving their own musicianship, the girls also teach other, less experienced children every Monday after school at Willow Oaks Elementary School\u2019s after-school music classes. For two hours the girls help out by putting on tapes and fastening shoulder pads, straightening backs and pointing out notes on the staff.\r\n\r\n\u201cEven though sometimes it feels impossible to get them [the kids] to listen or understand, I always feel kind of rewarded afterwards because I know that we\u2019re helping them develop one of the most important skills ever,\u201d Rohrer says. \u201cThe results aren\u2019t immediate, but it\u2019s really amazing to be able to help and watch the kids grow over time.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis summer, Chin and Rohrer are going to the PACO camp as \u201cChamber Music Fellows\u201d chosen by Director Ben Simon to coach kids in the program.\r\n\r\nAt this point, they are both accomplished senior musicians who stayed in Senior PACO for three years each. Chin is the orchestra\u2019s first viola, leader of her section.\r\n\r\n\u201cTessera is the best viola in the world,\u201d Rohrer says, grinning at Chin.\r\n\r\nRohrer is the first violinist and the concertmaster, chosen by Simon, for the concert coming up this March.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe holds lots of responsibility,\u201d Simon says, \u201cShe is one of the strongest violinists this year and she deserves the promotion.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girls have also gained recognition from their fellow musicians at PACO.\r\n\r\n\u201cMegan and Tessera are both very talented, accomplished, and hardworking people in and outside of orchestra,\u201d says Claire Chevallier, Paly junior and PACO musician. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to tell how dedicated and passionate they are about music when you hear them play.\u201d\r\n\r\nRohrer plans to major in violin performance at Northwestern University\u2019s Bienen School of Music this fall, and she also wants to sing in the school\u2019s choir program. Chin, who is majoring in computer science at Stanford University, says she will \u201ccontinue to play music no matter what.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen looking back at all these years at PACO, the girls feel that they\u2019ve acquired skills beyond the music world.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe best thing about PACO is that it teaches you about life,\u201d Chin says. \u201cTo teach, to cooperate, to follow and to lead.\u201d\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/laugh.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3826\" alt=\"laugh\" src=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/laugh.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\" \/><\/a>","excerpt":"On an ordinary\u00a0Wednesday night, a duet of string music can be heard spilling over the high wooden fence around the Chin family\u2019s home in Palo Alto.

Through their explosive shouts, the warriors announce their attacks immediately before the strike. The cuts are quick, and the three referees promptly raise their flags in response, touting the victor.\r\n\r\nThough they are loud, the two students are only part of the focus. With six to eight matches happening\u00a0 at any given time, the stomps, yells and strikes all blend together under the high arched roof of the dojo. Palo Alto High School senior Daiki Minaki\u2019s calls only contribute to the din as he trains against a fellow kendoka.\r\n\r\nMinaki began his kendo training at the age of 13, visiting a dojo once a week with his dad. He now travels to different dojos, practicing more than three times a week for at least three hours. His dedication has paid off \u2014 just last year, Minaki placed first in the 1-2 dan division of the Northern California Kendo Championships.\r\n\r\nMinaki is currently preparing for the All United States Kendo Federation National Championships in San Diego in May. Though this championship takes place every three years, Minaki attends six or seven competitions annually.\r\n\r\n\u201cI try to go to as many tournaments as I can \u2014 competitions are my favorite part [of Kendo],\u201d Minaki says. \u201cI like going in with my team and getting really pumped. Winning just feels really awesome.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough martial arts often evokes images of aggressive kicking and chopping, according to dojo instructor George Nishiura, kendo is less about force and strength; the kendoka instead relies on speed and endurance.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have to be focused,\u201d Nishiura says. \u201c[In] kendo, something happens in a split second. It\u2019s the fastest sport of any sport \u2026 focus, reflexes and concentration; I think it\u2019s the innate nature of kendo.\u201d\r\n\r\nMinaki agrees that a lot of his kendo skill comes from the mind, not the body.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of physical training,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you also need a lot of mental discipline if you want to succeed.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Minaki, kendo\u2019s resulting mental discipline helps his productivity when it comes to academic work.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to push myself, and I can work a lot harder because I put a lot of time and effort in kendo,\u201d Minaki says. \u201cThat translates into my schoolwork. If I really don\u2019t want to do something, I can now force myself to do it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHowever, kendo contributes to more than just the individual mind. According to Nishiura, the mental discipline kendo requires extends to a kendoka\u2019s everyday character.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe main subject of kendo is not hitting each other, but trying to build character that\u2019s good for society,\u201d Nishiura says. \u201c[Minaki] takes the training very seriously \u2026 it makes him a very dependable person. If I ask him to do something, he does it. There is no question asked.\u201d\r\n\r\nKendo\u2019s focus on good character is reflected in the competition evaluation. At tournaments, kendoka are ranked based on their kendo skill and their spirit and respect for their opponents. The kendoka cannot progress through the ranks unless they show good self-control.\r\n\r\nMinaki doesn\u2019t have any specific plans for the future of his kendo career, but he knows he wants to continue advancing his current rank of first dan after he graduates.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to get at least to fourth dan,\u201d he says. \u201cI might take a break in college, and start again after.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut according to Nishiura, despite all stops and starts, kendo is for life.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lifelong learning experience,\u201d Nishiura says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any endpoint to kendo training, so everybody at any stage are beginners. At the same time, they are experienced.\u2026 We don\u2019t know exactly where we are in the cycle.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the spiritual equality, kendoka ranks are taken seriously in the dojo. At the end of each practice, the men and women form two lines: one of senseis and one of students.\r\n\r\n\u201cRespect\u2019s a big part,\u201d Minaki says. \u201cYou bow to the front \u2026 you pay respects to be able use the facility. You bow to \u2026 everyone you practiced with. ... Then you bow to your senseis.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs students begin to form a separate line in front of the senseis to receive comments on their performance, Minaki breaks away to kneel behind Nishiura. He quietly takes Nishiura\u2019s protective armor and begins to fold it.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just common,\u201d Minaki says. \u201cThe younger people in the dojo tend to do it for the more respected.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Nishiura, Minaki has shown great promise, both in sparring skill and kendo character.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good kid,\u201d Nishiura says. \u201cI think he will be a very useful person for society.\u201d","excerpt":"Two guttural yells ring through the dojo as masked figures lunge toward one another.
